# Copy Pasta

Copy Pasta is a simple clipboard management tool that allows you to save and manage snippets of text copied to your clipboard. It provides a user-friendly interface to store, retrieve, and organize frequently used text snippets, making it easy to access and reuse them whenever needed.

## Features

- Clipboard Monitoring: Copy Pasta continuously monitors your clipboard for changes. When it detects a new text entry, it automatically saves it to the application for future use.

- Text Storage: All copied text snippets are stored in a persistent file (`data.txt`), ensuring that your snippets are preserved even when you restart the application.

- Copy and Paste: Copy Pasta provides a convenient "Copy" button that allows you to copy any selected text from the list of snippets back to the clipboard, ready to be pasted in any application.

- Removal and Clearing: You can remove individual snippets from the list or clear the entire snippet history with the provided options.


## Roadmap

- Templates: Copy Pasta allows you to save selected snippets as templates, making it easy to store and reuse commonly used pieces of text. (Under Develpment)
